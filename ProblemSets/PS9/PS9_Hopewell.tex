\section{Question 6: LASSO}
Optimal lambda is 0.0291, in-sample RMSE is 0.1970, out-of-sample RMSE is 0.1679

\section{Question 7: Ridge Regression}
Optimal lambda is .107, in-sample RMSE is 0.1714, out-of-sample RMSE is 0.1393

\section{Question 8: Elastic Net}
Optimal lambda is 0.02626685, optimal alpha is 0.1, out-of-sample RMSE is 0.1403. We should use ridge regression for this task because alpha is close to 0.
