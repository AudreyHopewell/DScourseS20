\section{Data Sources}
I am interested in gathering data from Twitter, and I am interested in the film industry/film criticism, so I think it would be interesting to collect data about movies. Since it is currently "awards season," there are plenty of people (both film critics/culture writers and lay movie fans) talking about movies on Twitter. However, this isn't typically unified by a specific hashtag, so figuring out how to filter and get the data I want would probably take some work. 


\section{Question 6}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item df1 is a data frame, df is a "SparkDataFrame"
    \item we get an error saying "unable to find an inherited method for function ‘select’ for signature ‘"data.frame"" because select is a Spark
    command that doesn't work with a normal R data frame
    \item we get an error saying "unable to find an inherited method for function ‘filter’ for signature ‘"data.frame"" because filter is a Spark
    command that doesn't work with a normal R data frame
\end{enumerate}
