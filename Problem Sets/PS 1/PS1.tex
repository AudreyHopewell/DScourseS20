\section{My Interests}
I wanted to take this class because after taking Dr. Wang's Statistics for Decision-Making class, I wanted to deepen my knowledge of data management and analysis and increase my familiarity with programming. I'm especially excited to expand my knowledge of programming languages besides R, and to learn more about gathering data via web scraping. I enjoyed the (very basic) sentiment analysis I did in the Stats class, so I hope I'll get to incorporate that in a more rigorous way in my final project, although I'm not sure what exactly I want to do. I'm excited that this class will provide an opportunity to learn more hard skills than most Econ classes I've taken.

More broadly, I am interested in game theory, social networks, and development economics (especially in regards to experimental/study design). I also have a major in Political Science, so I enjoy thinking about how economic theory translates into policy and how the nuances of public administration affect outcomes. I'm not sure what I want to do after I graduate - hopefully something in the economic or policy analysis field, either at the Federal Reserve or in the private sector.
